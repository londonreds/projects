# Creating Public Repos for Momentum Projects

## GitHub for public, GitLab for private
We use GitHub for public repos as GitHub is the most used repository tool and it makes it easier for people to find our projects. 
We use GitLab for private repos as it is free for this purpose. 

### A project is suitable for a public repo if: 
1. It does not give Momentum a strategic benefit to keep it secret
2. It does not store private data in the repo
3. It correctly respects the licence of any 3rd party libraries and resources

### A project is suitable for a private repo if: 
	1. There a strategic benefit to keeping it private e.g. is it a secret tool that we want to launch and steal a march with?
	2. It is under max size limit e.g. 10GB
