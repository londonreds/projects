# How to use this GitHub repo


## Learn about the Momentum Tech Network
Under the `Wiki` tab there are several help guides to get you started. 

## See what we are working on
Under the `Issues` tab there are a list of projects we are working on. If you prefer to see these organised a little more intuitively, please see our [Waffle (kanban) project board](https://waffle.io/PeoplesMomentum/projects) which displays them according to progress. Note: Waffle automagically syncs with GitHub.  

## Note to developers
This repo is not for code. We are using it as project management tool (or "meta" repo for tech projects).
