# How to use Slack

## What is Slack?
* Slack is a communications tool which allows real-time messaging in groups. 
* It's a private space to collaborate with other volunteers.
* You can use it online, install it on your computer or on your phone. 
* Messages are deleted after 10,000 so don't rely on Slack as a record of information

## How is Slack used?
Most times a group that is collaborating on a project will create a new channel in Slack. When you join Slack you will only be able to see the *Getting Started* and *Social* channels but you can join any other channels by clicking on the *Channels* title on the left hand menu. 

**Note:** You won't be able to see private channels. Please think carefully before creating a private channel. 

## What if there is no Slack channel for the project I am interested in?
It's possible that no-one is yet working that project, or that collaboration is happening elsewhere. The Momentum Tech Network is self-organising so some volunteers may have found another way to communicate that they prefer. Try asking in the *Getting Started* channel if you're not sure what is going on.
