Welcome to the Momentum Tech Network!

## Who are we?

We are a self-organising group of volunteers who work together on projects to help Momentum achieve its aims. We focus on using tech to amplify Momentum's work and increase its reach. 

## What do we do?
Projects range from enabling regional Momentum groups to use tech more effectively to building new secret weapons to gain an advantage in the next General Election. Nothing we do involves hacking into other organisations' systems. All our projects are shown in the issues section of this GitHub repo. 

## When did it start?
The network emerged from a tech collaboration weekend in London on 16th and 17th July 2017. 

## Why is the network needed?
Without tech Momentum wouldn't have been able to achieve all the things it has so far. By creating niche tools to support our campaigning we've been able to mobilise supporters in unprecedented numbers. This is the new politics and it's people-powered! We have an amazing resource in our volunteers' passion, skills and knowledge. By connecting and facilitating each one of you we increase our impact massively. 

## How do I get involved?
We're a self-organising group so you don't need permission to get stuck in! Some great places to start are: 

* Project board - take a look at projects in flight and waiting to be claimed on the [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/PeoplesMomentum/projects) 
* Group discussion - [Request to join our team Slack](https://momentum-builders.slack.com) where we collaborate on the projects
* Read our [Mission and Purpose](https://github.com/PeoplesMomentum/projects/blob/master/README.md) to get fired up about all the good we want to create
